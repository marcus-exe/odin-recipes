    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Just for noticing, the recipe that I am describing is the brazillian version.
        So naturallt is a bit different from what you may expect, if you are reading this 
    </p>
    <p>It's composed of Beef, preferably a not so fat one, milk cream, black pepper, 
        probrably something alcoholic and more stuff. Above all, it must be served with rice and
        "Batata Palha"
    </p>
    <p>Disclaimer: the next steps aren't related to the brazillian version</p>
